                <h3>DEVELOPMENTALLY APPROPRIATE PRACTICE</h3>
                <p>
                    This document outlines a principle of developmentally appropriate practice I value.  These principles were instituted by the NAEYC.
                    It is important to be aware of DAP principles because these tools can be used to better understand children and how to help them learn effectively.
                    While reviewing this document, you will find that I value fostering a child's sense of purpose and belonging by connecting their learning to their home and family life.

                <h3>HOME ASSESSMENT</h3>
                <p>
                    A home assessment is an opportunity for a child development specialist to visit with a parent while observing a child's home interaction.  For this project, I had the opportunity to perform an assessment.
                    Home assessments are valuable because they are an opportunity to lend support to parents in the home.
                    From this document, you can observe that I value understanding the different aspects of a child's life that I may more effectively teach to their understanding and needs.

                <h3>SOLO LESSON PLAN</h3>
                <p>
                    This document is a lesson plan that was used in the BYU-Idaho toddler labs.
                    For me, lesson plans are important because they are an opportunity to provide structure and purpose to a child's learning.
                    While planning lessons, I value teaching to the specific needs of children, including goal setting, and planning for all domains of development.
